    comment: The final data cube of the neutral hydrogen emission in HCG 16. Can be compared with the equivalent file stored at https://b2share.eudat.eu/records/a69a7b2dcc22449e8734552dde4d3906.
  - file: HCG16_CD_rob0_MS.pbcor.fits
    comment: As above, but imaged at a higher resolution and lower sensitivity. Can be compared with the equivalent file stored at https://b2share.eudat.eu/records/a69a7b2dcc22449e8734552dde4d3906.
  - file: HCG16_CD_rob2_MS_mask.fits
    comment: A mask that encompasses all the emission of the group. Generated with the SoFiA software (https://github.com/SoFiA-Admin/SoFiA). Can be compared with the equivalent file stored at https://b2share.eudat.eu/records/a69a7b2dcc22449e8734552dde4d3906.
